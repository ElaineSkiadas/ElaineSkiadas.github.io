            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Elaine Skiadas—a multidisciplinary artist, photographer, and writer with a background in visual storytelling and experiential design. I began my creative career in the culinary arts, specializing in food photography and recipe development. What started as an exploration of light, texture, and composition on the plate evolved into a broader artistic practice that now includes painting, woodworking, multimedia installation, and interactive digital art.

            <h2>Journey of a Sea Turtle</h2>
            <p>This interactive game immerses players in the perilous journey that sea turtles face from hatchling to adulthood. Using arrow key controls, players must navigate a series of obstacles and avoid natural predators such as seagulls, crabs, and sharks—mirroring the real-world threats young turtles encounter on the beach and in the ocean. Educational snippets are woven throughout the game to highlight key facts and raise awareness about sea turtle conservation.</p>

            <h2>Press Fit Lantern</h2>
            <p>This piece marked my introduction to both laser cutting and woodworking. I've always been drawn to the soft, ambient glow that lamps bring to an indoor space, and I wanted to design something that felt both warm and organic.
The laser-cut pattern on each press-fit component was inspired by the natural geometry of succulents.</p>
